Arduino Pomodoro Timer
======================

Basic pomodoro timer in Arduino. Runs for 25 minutes and then raises a flag and plays a little tune. There is [a blog article](http://devcorner.mynewsdesk.com/2011/06/15/hardvaruhacking-i-en-post-pc-varld/) about it in swedish.

Load `pomodoro.pde` in the [Arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to get the software for the project.

Load `pomodoro.fz` in [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) to see how the hardware is setup.
